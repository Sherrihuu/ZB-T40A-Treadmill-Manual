## 7. Product Maintenance & Care

> **Warning**: Always **turn off the power and unplug** the treadmill before cleaning or maintenance.

<a name="section71"></a>
### 7.1 Cleaning

1. **Surface Cleaning**  
   - Wipe down the walking belt and exterior with a soft, dry cloth or lightly damp cloth.  
   - Do not allow water or cleaning fluid to drip into the motor or control areas.
2. **Belt Edges**  
   - Remove dust and debris around the belt edges to prevent accumulation under the belt.

<a name="section72"></a>
### 7.2 Lubricating the Running Belt

- Proper lubrication between the belt and deck is essential for performance and longevity.  
- The treadmill is pre-lubricated at the factory, but regular lubrication is recommended based on usage:  
  - **Light usage (under 3 hours/week)**: Lubricate every **1 month**  
  - **Heavy usage (over 7 hours/week)**: Lubricate every **2 weeks**  

**How to lubricate**:  
1. Gently lift one side of the belt.  
2. Apply silicone oil onto the deck surface.  
3. Run the treadmill at low speed for 1–2 minutes to distribute the oil evenly.

<a name="section73"></a>
### 7.3 Belt Alignment & Tension Adjustment

1. **Centering the Belt**  
   - Run the treadmill at **2–3 km/h** and observe the belt’s alignment.  
   - If it drifts right, turn the **right** adjustment bolt **clockwise** (1/2 turn) and the **left** bolt **counterclockwise** (1/2 turn).  
   - Reverse the steps if it drifts left.
2. **Tension**  
   - If the belt slips during use, it may be too loose.  
   - If the motor noise is excessive or the rollers wear quickly, it may be too tight.  
   - Adjust each side **1/4–1/2 turn** at a time, testing repeatedly until correct tension is achieved.
